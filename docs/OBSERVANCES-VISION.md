# Observances & calendar: scope and vision

## Current scope: USA (America-first)

Observances in **lib/holidaysAndObservancesUS.js** are **USA-focused**: federal holidays, cultural and food observances, music milestones, fan-culture and fun days. They are kept **thorough** so activity directors have something for **everyone**—from birth to death and everything in between—with a wide range of interests:

- **Federal & cultural:** Major holidays, heritage, remembrance, family (Mother’s Day, Father’s Day, Grandparents Day).
- **Food & drink:** Thematic days for menus and specials (e.g. National Pizza Day, Margarita Day, Coffee Day).
- **Music:** Birth/death anniversaries and milestones for trivia and themed nights.
- **Fun & quirky:** Pets, puzzles, kindness, relaxation, games—broad appeal across ages.
- **Fan culture:** Star Wars, Trek, Doctor Who, Talk Like a Pirate, Back to the Future, comics, video games.

All dates are verified from authoritative or widely cited sources; nothing is made up. Categories support filtering (e.g. “just food” or “just music”) in the activity calendar and theme picker.

## Future vision: global, regional, situational

- **Global:** Other countries’ holidays and observances (e.g. UK, Canada, Australia, Mexico) so international venues or audiences can plan themes.
- **Regional:** State or regional observances (e.g. state holidays, local heritage days) where relevant.
- **Situational:** Context-specific sets (e.g. “senior living,” “school,” “corporate”) with tailored lists and layouts.

Planned directions:

- Separate data files or modules per region/country (e.g. `holidaysAndObservancesUK.js`, `holidaysAndObservancesCA.js`), with the same category and date structure.
- Calendar **layouts and designs** that can vary by region or context (different default themes, optional branding).
- Activity calendar UI that can **choose region/context** (e.g. “USA,” “UK,” “Senior living”) and load the right observances and optional layout.

Respecting local holidays and special dates is a core part of the vision; the current USA-only set is the first step.
