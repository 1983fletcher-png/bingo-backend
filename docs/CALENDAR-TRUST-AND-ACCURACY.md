# Calendar & observances: trust and accuracy

We build trust from the beginning. Every date and observance we show is held to a high standard: **cross-referenced, double- and triple-checked, and only promoted when we’re confident it’s correct.**

---

## Our standards

1. **Every date is factual.** We do not publish observances or calendar dates that we haven’t verified. No guesswork, no “maybe” dates.
2. **Cross-reference.** When we add or change an observance, we verify against at least one authoritative or widely cited source (e.g. OPM for federal holidays, National Day Calendar or equivalent for national days, timeanddate.com for Easter). See **docs/DATE-VERIFICATION-SOURCES.md**.
3. **Planning ahead.** People plan a year in advance. Our calendar and observances are correct for **2026 and 2027** (and we extend where appropriate, e.g. Easter through 2028). Nth-weekday holidays (MLK Day, Thanksgiving, etc.) are computed so they are correct for any year.
4. **Respectful and above board.** We only use **public information**. When we “import” events from a venue’s website, we use the URL the activity director or host provides and only extract what is publicly visible on that page. We do not access private data, bypass terms of service, or do anything illegal. Future integrations (e.g. Facebook events) will use only official APIs and approved methods. See **docs/FACEBOOK-INSTAGRAM-EVENTS.md**.
5. **Check and balance.** Before we add a new observance or change a date, we confirm it against our verification sources and, when in doubt, leave it out until we’re sure.

## What we verify

- **Federal holidays (USA):** OPM and standard nth-weekday rules.
- **Easter:** Computed/verified for 2026, 2027, 2028 (and updated as needed).
- **National / cultural / food / fun days:** National Day Calendar, National Today, timeanddate.com, or other cited sources. Fixed dates and nth-weekday rules checked.
- **Music anniversaries:** Wikipedia, Britannica, or other reliable biography/obituary sources.
- **Event import from venue URL:** We only read the public content of the page the user pastes. We do not store that content beyond the session; we only extract dates and titles to show on their calendar. The venue owns their site; we don’t access anything they haven’t made public.

## One-click ease, without cutting corners

Activity directors and hosts get a simple flow: **paste your website, get dates and event info** to help plan. That ease is built on:

- **Legal, public-only data** from the URL they provide.
- **Accurate observances** that we’ve verified so they can trust what’s on the calendar.
- **Clear language** so they know we’re importing public event information from their site, not “scraping” in an aggressive or unauthorized way.

We keep implementation as simple as possible while staying above board and maintaining trust.
