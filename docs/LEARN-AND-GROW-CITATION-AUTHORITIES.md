# Learn & Grow — Citation authorities and linking

**Purpose:** Every Learn & Grow card is only as good as its sources. We cite **data-backed, science-driven** work from respected institutions and link to more advanced systems so learners and caregivers can go deeper. This doc defines preferred authority types and how we use them.

## Preferred institution types

We prioritize sources that are:

- **Government science agencies** — USDA, NIH, NSF, NOAA, CDC (for health/safety), EPA, USGS, NASA. Data and guidelines are publicly accountable and evidence-based.
- **Research universities** — Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stanford, and other R1 institutions; their extension programs, open courseware, and public outreach. We link to .edu and official university domains.
- **Cooperative Extension** — Land-grant university extension (e.g. extension.org, state extension services). Research-based, practical, and regionally relevant.
- **Museums and public science institutions** — Smithsonian, Exploratorium, American Museum of Natural History, botanical gardens, etc. Trusted for education and public engagement.
- **Respected encyclopedias and reference** — Encyclopaedia Britannica, peer-reviewed summaries. We use for overview and definitions; we prefer linking to primary research or institutions when possible.
- **Peer-reviewed literature** — When we cite journal articles, we use stable identifiers (DOI, PubMed) and keep language accessible; Deep Dive layer can reference directly.

We **do not** use: unsourced blogs, commercial “edu” marketing, social media as primary source, or anything that conflicts with the above. When in doubt, we choose the more authoritative and link to “more advanced” so curious users can verify and go deeper.

## How we cite and link

- **Every card has a `sources` array** — Each entry includes title, institution, URL (when available), and optional year/note. No claim in the card should be untraceable to at least one listed source.
- **We never copy; we summarize and attribute** — Content is written in our voice; facts are traceable to the source. We link so readers can open the original.
- **“Learn more” and advanced systems** — Where appropriate, we link to university courses, government portals, or museum resources so that “I want to go deeper” is one click away (e.g. MIT OpenCourseWare, USDA tools, Smithsonian Learning Lab).
- **Double-check before publish** — URLs and institution names are verified. Links open to the intended page; we avoid link rot by preferring stable, official URLs (e.g. .gov, .edu, major museums).

## Summary

- **Truth first:** Data-backed, science-driven, from top-notch authorities.
- **Link to more:** Every card points to more advanced systems (Harvard, MIT, Princeton, USDA, NSF, museums, extension) so the path from “fun at home” to “I want the full picture” is clear and trustworthy.
