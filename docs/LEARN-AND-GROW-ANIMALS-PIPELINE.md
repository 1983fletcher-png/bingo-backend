# Learn & Grow — Animals pipeline

**Purpose:** We're going deep on animals: the ones we live alongside, the ones we admire, and the ones in the sea. This doc tracks which animal cards we're building and the order we're rolling them out. Every card follows the same bar: four audience layers, activities, and top-tier citations (Smithsonian, IUCN, National Zoo, universities, etc.).

## Rollout order (dive deep, keep rolling)

We create **a few cards at a time** and go deep. Then we add more. All cards link to each other and to Plants/Crafts where it makes sense.

### First batch (done)

| Card ID | Title | Scope | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| `cats-of-the-world` | Cats of the World | Felidae: house cat, lion, tiger, leopard, jaguar, puma, lynx, cheetah, and all cat family. Big cats and small. | Done |
| `dogs-and-their-relatives` | Dogs & Their Relatives | Canidae: dogs, wolves, foxes, and cousins. Domestication, behavior, conservation. | Done |
| `sloths` | Sloths | Two-toed, three-toed, pygmy sloth. Biology, “life in slow motion,” rainforest, conservation. | Done |

### Second batch (done)

| Card ID | Title | Scope | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| `raccoons` | Raccoons | Adaptable neighbor; USDA FEIS, Britannica. | Done |
| `opossums` | Opossums & Relatives | Virginia opossum; Smithsonian Zoo, NPS. | Done |
| `pandas` | Giant Pandas & Red Pandas | Giant + red panda; Smithsonian Zoo. | Done |
| `goats-sheep-cows` | Goats, Sheep & Cows | Ruminants, domestication; USDA, extension. | Done |

### Third batch (done)

- **birds** — Migration, flight, feathers; Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center, Britannica.
- **whales** — Cetaceans, baleen/toothed; NOAA Fisheries.
- **sharks** — 500+ species, science over myth; Smithsonian Ocean, NOAA.
- **ocean-invertebrates** — Crabs, Octopus & Squid; cephalopods and crabs; Smithsonian Ocean, NMNH.

### Fourth batch (done) — slimy, scaly, creepy-crawly, unique

- **reptiles** — Snakes, Lizards & Turtles; scaly, Smithsonian Reptile Discovery Center, Britannica.
- **amphibians** — Frogs, Toads & Salamanders; slimy, moist; Smithsonian Saving Amphibians, Britannica.
- **spiders-and-relatives** — Spiders & Their Relatives; arachnids, silk, Smithsonian Education, NMNH.
- **insects** — Beetles, Flies, Mosquitoes & Insect Relatives; pollinators, USDA, Smithsonian Pollinator Garden.
- **platypus-capybara** — Platypus, Capybara & Other Unique Creatures; monotreme, largest rodent; Britannica, San Diego Zoo, Rainforest Alliance.
- **marsupials** — Kangaroos, Koalas & More; pouches, joeys; Smithsonian wallabies, Britannica.

### Next (rolling along)

| Card ID | Title | Scope |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `birds` | Birds | Diversity, flight, derivatives (feathers, eggs). From backyard birds to raptors; link to ecosystems. |
| `whales` | Whales | Cetaceans: biology, migration, conservation. Baleen and toothed whales. |
| `sharks` | Sharks | Diversity, anatomy, role in ocean ecosystems. Science over myth. |
| `ocean-invertebrates` | Crabs, Octopus & Squid | Crustaceans and cephalopods. Anatomy, behavior, “smart” invertebrates. |

We may split or merge (e.g. “Ocean life” vs separate whale/shark/cephalopod cards) as we go. The goal is depth and citation, not speed.

## Citation bar for animals

- **Smithsonian:** National Museum of Natural History (mammals, research), National Zoo & Conservation Biology Institute (species pages, conservation).
- **IUCN:** Cat Specialist Group, Red List, other specialist groups for conservation status and taxonomy.
- **Universities & research:** Peer-reviewed mammalogy, zoology, and conservation biology; Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (e.g. sloths, rainforest).
- **Government/wildlife:** USFWS, NOAA (marine), state wildlife agencies where relevant.

Every card lists sources with title, institution, URL, and note. We link to “more advanced” so readers can go deeper.

---

## Interconnection

- Animal cards link to **plants-and-how-they-grow** (habitat, food chains) and **crafts-and-gentle-stem** (observation, science at home) where relevant.
- Animal cards link to each other (e.g. cats ↔ dogs as carnivores; sloths ↔ plants/rainforest).
- Tags: `animals`, `biology`, `mammals`, `conservation`, plus specific tags (`cats`, `dogs`, `sloths`, `marine`, etc.) for filtering.

## Summary

- **First batch:** Cats, Dogs, Sloths. **Second:** Raccoons, Opossums, Pandas, Goats/Sheep/Cows. **Third:** Birds, Whales, Sharks, Crabs/Octopus/Squid. **Fourth:** Reptiles, Amphibians, Spiders & Relatives, Insects, Platypus/Capybara, Marsupials. All deep, cited, four layers, activities.
- We keep rolling with same quality bar and citation standards for any new cards.
