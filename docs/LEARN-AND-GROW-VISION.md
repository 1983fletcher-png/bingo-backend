# Playroom: Learn & Grow — Knowledge Module & Flagship Cards

**System / product vision context.** This document is the single source of truth for the Learn & Grow module. Do not violate the core values or the knowledge card requirements when designing or building.

---

## Mission (non-negotiable)

**Playroom: Learn & Grow** is a truth-first, globally accessible knowledge center designed for the general public — **ages 4 through 99+** — with layered depth, emotional safety, scientific rigor, and radical accessibility.

**Mission:** Share truthful, well-sourced knowledge freely, without shame, gatekeeping, or manipulation — to help people learn, grow, and trust themselves.

- This is **not** opinion content.
- This is **not** sensational content.
- This is **not** algorithm-bait.
- This **is** calm, confident, compassionate education inspired by the best academic institutions in the world, adapted for real human beings.

## Core values (do not violate)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|--------|
| **Truth over trends** | Evidence and accuracy over virality or fads. |
| **Evidence over opinion** | Cite sources; distinguish fact from interpretation. |
| **Accessibility without dumbing down** | Layer depth (Child → Deep Dive); never talk down. |
| **Compassion without condescension** | Respect the learner; no shame for "not knowing." |
| **Neutrality on sensitive topics** | Present science and context; avoid ideological framing. |
| **Curiosity without judgment** | Welcome questions; never shame curiosity. |
| **Confidence-building through understanding** | Learning leads to "I can understand this." |
| **No gatekeeping of knowledge** | Knowledge is a public good; we don't withhold. |
| **Citations are mandatory** | Every card lists clear, reputable sources. |

**All knowledge must be:**

- Cross-referenced
- Clearly sourced
- Ethically summarized (never copied)
- Respectful of cultural, cognitive, and age diversity

---

## Knowledge card system (required)

Each **Knowledge Card** must follow this layered learning model.

### 1. Title

Clear, neutral, descriptive.

### 2. One-sentence summary

Simple, calming, confidence-building.

### 3. Audience layers (selectable)

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| **Child** | Visual, minimal text, gentle tone. |
| **Learner** | Step-by-step basics. |
| **Explorer** | Conceptual depth. |
| **Deep Dive** | Academic rigor, citations. |

### 4. Core sections (as applicable)

- What this is
- Why it matters
- How it works
- Key facts
- Step-by-step explanations
- Real-world examples

### 5. STEM anchors

Explicitly tag where relevant:

- Science
- Math
- Engineering
- Systems thinking
- Real-world application

### 6. Activities & engagement

When appropriate, include:

- Crafts
- Gentle experiments
- Observation activities
- Group activities
- Trivia hooks (for later integration with Playroom games)

### 7. Sources & references (mandatory)

**Only use:**

- Peer-reviewed journals
- University extension programs
- Government science agencies
- Respected encyclopedias
- Museums and research institutions

All sources must be listed clearly at the end of each card.

---

## UI / experience principles

- **Calm, grounded visual design**
- **Subtle depth** (soft shadows, embossed edges)
- **No visual clutter**; no cognitive overload
- **Gentle curiosity hooks**
- **No autoplay, no flashing, no aggressive motion**
- **Mascots** (dog "Mabel" and cat "Donut") may exist as non-intrusive branding elements, never as distractions

The experience should feel:

> *"I'm safe here. I can take my time. I'm allowed to learn."*

## First 10 flagship knowledge cards (build these)

These define the foundation of the entire system. Each must be scalable, expandable, and deeply interconnected.

| # | Card | Scope |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | **Animals of the World** | Biology, classification, behavior, ecosystems, A–Z indexing, age-adaptive visuals and depth. |
| 2 | **Crafts & Gentle STEM** | Low-cost, household-based activities that teach real science through play. |
| 3 | **Cooking Basics & Food Safety** | Fact-based food preparation, safety, and cooking science (no cultural bias, no trends). |
| 4 | **Plants & How They Grow** | Botany, gardening, food plants, ornamentals, climate zones, sustainability. |
| 5 | **Human Body Fundamentals** | Honest, neutral, non-sensational explanations of body systems. |
| 6 | **Mind & Emotion** | Brain basics, emotional regulation, habits, confidence, learning how learning works. |
| 7 | **Physics in Everyday Life** | Forces, motion, sound, light, energy — explained through daily experiences. |
| 8 | **Earth & Environment** | Water, soil, weather, ecosystems, climate basics, environmental stewardship. |
| 9 | **Health & Nutrition** | Nutrition science, hydration, balance, body needs — fact-based, not diet culture. |
| 10 | **How Things Work** | Everyday technology, tools, systems, and infrastructure explained clearly. |

## Interconnection requirement

Every card must:

- **Link to related cards**
- **Share common tags**
- Be usable for **trivia, education, crafts, and group activities**
- Support **future expansion** (neurodivergent learning paths, accessibility presets, language localization)

---

## Sensitive topics guidelines

- Treat **biology as biology** — not taboo, not sensational.
- Maintain **global neutrality**.
- Use **clinical, respectful language**.
- **Never shame curiosity**.
- **Always contextualize with science**.
- **Defer to evidence, not ideology**.

---

## Future considerations (do not build yet — design for)

- Neurodivergent learning presets
- Accessibility layers (reading level, visuals, pacing)
- LGBTQ+ education modules handled with neutrality and evidence
- Group facilitation tools
- Trivia and game integrations (with existing Playroom trivia/bingo)
- Offline / printable versions
- Community contribution with editorial review

---

## Relationship to Playroom

- **Learn & Grow** is the **knowledge layer** that can feed **Edutainment** (trivia, flashcards, teach-then-check), **Music Bingo** themes, and **activity director** content. See **docs/EDUTAINMENT-VISION.md** and **docs/LEARN-AND-GROW-KNOWLEDGE-CARD-SPEC.md** for schema and implementation.
- The same values (truth, accessibility, no shame) apply across the platform.

---

## Final directive

Build Playroom: Learn & Grow as if it will be trusted by:

- Parents  
- Teachers  
- Caregivers  
- Schools  
- Libraries  
- Retirement communities  
- Curious individuals worldwide  

**This is not a website.**  
**This is a public good.**  
**Design accordingly.**
