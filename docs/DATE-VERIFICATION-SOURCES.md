# Date verification sources — observances database

**Rule:** Every date in `lib/holidaysAndObservancesUS.js` must be factual and verified. No made-up dates. Multiple checks.

**Operational context:** System reference date **February 4, 2026**. All “upcoming” and theme suggestions are **forward-looking** from this date. We do not suggest or surface past holidays—only the next ones coming up. Every date on the calendar is correct and proper for 2026 and beyond.

This doc records authoritative sources used to verify entries. When adding or changing observances, verify against at least one primary source and document it here.
