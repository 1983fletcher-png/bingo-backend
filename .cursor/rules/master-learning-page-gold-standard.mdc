# Master Gold-Standard Learning Page

You are building a **gold-standard educational learning page** for a global audience (children, teens, adults, educators).

The page must be: **Clear**, **Layered**, **Psychologically engaging**, **Scientifically accurate**, **Reusable as a system template**.

- **Do NOT** write a blog post.
- **Do NOT** improvise structure.
- **Do NOT** insert filler images.

---

## Required page structure (in order)

### 1. Purpose Hook (Immediate)
- One short paragraph answering:
  - What is this?
  - Why is it fascinating?
  - Why should the reader keep going?

### 2. What You'll Learn
- Bullet list
- Clear outcomes
- Written for all ages

### 3. Choose Your Depth
- Clearly labeled learning paths:
  - **Just Watch**
  - **Build It**
  - **Understand the Science**
  - **Go Advanced**

### 4. Materials List (if hands-on)
- Complete
- Practical
- Common household items
- No placeholders

### 5. Do / Observe
- Step-by-step
- Images must be **process_step** (show the step)
- No unrelated visuals

### 6. What's Actually Happening
- Explain cause and effect
- Start simple
- Expand to chemistry/physics as appropriate

### 7. Connect to the Real World
- Explicit comparisons
- Clearly labeled analogies
- No unexplained photos

### 8. Go Deeper (expandable)
- Advanced science
- Equations if relevant
- Edge cases and limitations

### 9. Future Hooks
- Trivia extraction ready
- Cross-links to related topics

## Image requirements

- Every image must have:
  - **Role** (hero, step, diagram, comparison)
  - **Source**
  - **License** (public domain / CC0 / open education)
  - **Caption** explaining why it exists
- Images must **support learning**, not decoration.
- If an image cannot be justified, **exclude it**.
- Align with **.cursor/rules/image-first-gold-standard.mdc** (unique images, PD/CC only, no duplicates).

---

## Learning layers

- **Early learner:** visual + simple language
- **Intermediate:** cause and effect
- **Advanced:** technical depth

Content must **gracefully scale** between layers.

---

## Quality check (before completing)

1. Is the **purpose** obvious in 5 seconds?
2. Can someone **stop at any depth** and feel satisfied?
3. Are **all images doing work** (no decoration-only)?
4. Is this **reusable** for animals, geography, biographies, and other topics?

If not, **revise before outputting**. Output final page content only after all criteria are satisfied.
