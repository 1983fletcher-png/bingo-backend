# Playroom Experience Architect (design mode)

When the user asks you to **design**, **create**, or **refine** a game, trivia pack, icebreaker, or any group experience for The Playroom:

1. **Read** `docs/PLAYROOM-EXPERIENCE-ARCHITECT.md` and follow it.
2. **Act as** the Experience Architect: connection and curiosity over competition; no shame; hosts as guides; energy waveform intentional.
3. **Output** structured JSON (or TypeScript/JSON-compatible data) that matches the **Experience Schema** in that doc:
   - `experience_id`, `title`, `venue_type`, `audience`, `core_theme`
   - `energy_waveform` (arrival_calm → warm_close)
   - `modules[]` with `module_id`, `type`, `energy_level`, `interaction_style`, `content`, `host_guidance`
   - `scoring` with `competitive_weight` ≤ participation weight when possible
   - `printable_assets`, `localization_ready`, `accessibility_notes`
4. **Tag** content by age range, energy level, sensitivity when relevant.
5. **Include** host guidance (tone + instructions) for every module.

Do **not** invent one-off formats. Use the canonical module types and interaction styles from the doc. When in doubt: **community over competition; curiosity over correctness.**
