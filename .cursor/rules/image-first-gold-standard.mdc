# Image-First Gold Standard

Educational content must meet strict legal, scientific, and quality standards. **Before writing or rendering content, complete image ingestion successfully.**

## Image sourcing rules

- Use **only** public domain, CC0, or explicitly open educational sources.
- **Prioritize**: government and academic sources (NASA, USGS, NOAA, Smithsonian, NPS, Wikimedia PD).
- **Never** scrape Google Images, Pinterest, or unverified sites.

## Image requirements

- Every image must be **unique** (no duplicates or near-duplicates on the page).
- Each image must include: **source name**, **source URL**, **license type**, **category**, and **subject tags**.
- **Reject** images with watermarks, low resolution, or unclear licensing.

## Image slot logic

- Define **required image slots** based on topic depth:
  - Minimum **3** slots per page.
  - Typical **5–7** slots; expandable for deep topics.
- If an image slot **cannot be filled legally**, retry alternate sources (e.g. different Wikimedia file, another PD/CC source).
- If **still unresolved**, mark the page as **incomplete** and **stop generation** — do not ship with missing or unverified images.

## Learning layers

- Tag images for **early**, **intermediate**, and **advanced** learners where applicable.
- Ensure visuals support **explanation clarity** at each level.

## Do not

- **Guess**, **reuse** (same image in multiple slots without intent), or **fabricate** images or sources.
- Proceed with placeholder or unlicensed images.

If requirements cannot be met, **request clarification** instead of proceeding.
