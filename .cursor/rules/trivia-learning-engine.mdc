# Trivia + Learning: Engagement Engine

**Full spec:** `docs/TRIVIA-LEARNING-PLATFORM-DESIGN.md`

## What This Is

A **modular engagement engine**, not just trivia. Same content must work for: host screen, TV display, audience devices, and **fully printed packets**. Competition is optional; learning and discussion are first-class.

## Content Primitives (Mandatory)

- **FACT**: Verifiable statement + at least one reliable source; tagged (category, difficulty, age, tone).
- **QUESTION**: Built from one or more facts. Types: multiple choice, T/F, write-in, list, matching, ordering, fill-in-blank, guess-the-number, picture ID, scenario/discussion, opinion poll. Supports scoring or no scoring; partial credit where appropriate.
- **INSIGHT**: Reinforcement — why the answer matters, why people get it wrong, real-world application.

## Structure

- **Block**: 5–15 min unit (1–3 questions, or fact+prompt, or scenario+discussion). Reusable, printable, host-readable.
- **Round**: Energy container — pace, tone, interaction mode, scoring style. Archetypes: Easy Warm-Up, Mixed, Lists/Matching, Reasoning, Lightning.
- **Session**: Time-based recipe. Bar default: ~2 hr, 45–50 questions, 3 breaks; also support 20/30/60 min and passive TV loop.

## AI Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- AI may: draft from **verified** facts, adjust difficulty/tone, suggest prompts, flag ambiguity.
- AI may **not**: publish unverified facts, invent sources, override human approval, guess when uncertain.
- All factual content: cross-checked, source-backed, flagged if uncertain.

## When Generating a Pack

Output: pack title, audience, tone, session length, round structure; **per question**: text, type, accepted answer(s), difficulty, category, optional fun fact / discussion prompt / host notes. Format: clean, printable, host-readable, device-agnostic.
