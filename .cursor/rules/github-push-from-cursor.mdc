# Push from Cursor: use the token

**Failure when using plain push:**  
`fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': Device not configured`

Git tries to prompt for a username; in Cursor there is no interactive terminal, so the push fails. **Fix:** use the **GitHub token** so the push goes directly to GitHub (no username prompt).

**Always use the token:** Load **GITHUB_TOKEN** from this repo's **.env** or **env**, then run **scripts/git-push-with-token.sh** (or **deploy-playroom.sh**, which calls it). The script builds a URL like `https://TOKEN@github.com/owner/repo` and runs `git push <that-url> main`, so the push succeeds. For music-bingo-app, run the backend's **git-push-with-token.sh** from the app directory after sourcing the backend's .env.
