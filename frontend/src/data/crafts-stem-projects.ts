    ],
    science: 'Baking soda is a base (sodium bicarbonate); vinegar is an acid (acetic acid). When they mix, they react to form carbon dioxide gas — the same gas you breathe out. The gas needs more space than the liquid, so it pushes up and out as foam. Dish soap traps the gas in bubbles, making the eruption bigger and frothier. In short: acid + base → CO₂ gas → foam.',

    science: 'A bubble is a thin film of water sandwiched between two layers of soap molecules. Soap lowers the surface tension of water so the film can stretch without popping immediately. Glycerin or corn syrup keeps the film from drying out too fast. When you blow or pull, you’re trapping air inside; the film wants to shrink into a sphere because that shape uses the least surface area for the volume — that’s why bubbles are round.',

    science: 'Newton’s third law: for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The balloon pushes air backward (action); the air pushes the balloon forward (reaction).

    ],
    science: 'Paper towels are made of fibers with tiny gaps between them. Water is attracted to those fibers (adhesion) and to itself (cohesion). Together, that pull moves water upward against gravity — that’s capillary action. Plants use it to pull water from roots to leaves. The same process is why a sponge soaks up spills.',

Alka-Seltzer releases carbon dioxide bubbles in the water. Those bubbles attach to the colored water blobs and lift them up. When the bubbles pop at the top, the blobs sink again.

    science: 'Density is mass per unit volume. Heavier liquids (for the same amount of space) sink; lighter ones float. Honey is denser than syrup, which is denser than water, which is denser than oil. Because they don’t mix well, they stay in layers.
