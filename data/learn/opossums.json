      "summary": "Opossums are animals that carry their babies in a pouch, like kangaroos. They sometimes look like they are sleeping when they are scared — that’s “playing possum.”",
      "sections": {
        "what": "The Virginia opossum is a furry animal about the size of a cat. It has a long nose, a hairless tail it can use to hold on, and big ears. It is the only kind of opossum that lives in North America. Mom opossums carry their tiny babies in a pouch on their belly.",
        "why": "Opossums eat bugs, snails, and things we call pests. They help clean up dead animals and fruit that falls. They don’t hurt people. When we see one, we can leave it alone and let it do its job in nature.",
        "how": "Opossums are active at night. They climb and use their tail to grip. If they are very scared, they may fall over and look like they are dead — that’s “playing possum.” They eat almost anything: fruit, insects, small animals, and sometimes garbage. They don’t live long in the wild but help the ecosystem while they do.",
        "keyFacts": "Virginia opossum is North America’s only marsupial. It has 50 teeth — more than any other North American land mammal. It “plays possum” when scared. It eats ticks and other pests. It is not dangerous to people; we should not chase or hurt it."

      "summary": "The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is North America’s only marsupial — nocturnal, omnivorous, and famous for “playing possum”; beneficial to ecosystems and not a threat to people.",
      "sections": {
        "what": "The Virginia opossum (Didelphis virginiana) is a marsupial: females have a pouch where tiny, undeveloped young attach and nurse. It ranges from southern Canada to Costa Rica. It has a pointed snout, naked prehensile tail, and opposable toe on the hind foot for climbing. Grayish fur, about cat-sized (males 4.6–6.2 lb). It has 50 teeth — more than any other North American land mammal. It is not related to the Australian possum (different order); “opossum” is the correct name for this animal.",
        "why": "Opossums are opportunistic omnivores: they eat insects (including ticks), small vertebrates, fruit, carrion, and garbage. That makes them useful for pest control and cleanup. They rarely carry rabies (low body temperature may be a factor) and are not aggressive. They are often hit by cars; otherwise they adapt well to suburbs and woods. Protecting them means not harming them and reducing road mortality where possible.",
        "how": "Nocturnal and mostly solitary. When threatened, they may hiss, bare teeth, or flee. Young may “play possum” — enter a catatonic state, lie still, and even produce a smell that discourages predators. Adults do this less often. They climb well and use the tail for balance and grip. Gestation is only 12–13 days; up to 25 tiny young crawl to the pouch and attach to a nipple. They stay in the pouch about two months, then ride on mom’s back.",
        "keyFacts": "Lifespan in the wild often 1.5–2 years; in captivity 3–4 years. Two to three litters per year. Smithsonian National Zoo and NPS provide species accounts. They are not dangerous; if one is in your yard, you can leave it alone or encourage it to move by removing attractants. Never handle wild opossums without trained help.",
        "stepByStep": "1. Use Smithsonian National Zoo or NPS to read about Virginia opossum diet and behavior. 2. List two ways they help ecosystems (e.g. eating ticks, cleaning carrion). 3. Explain “playing possum” in one sentence. 4. Name one way to help them (e.g. slow down at night where they cross, don’t use poison that could harm them).",
        "realWorldExamples": "Smithsonian National Zoo has Virginia opossums and educational material. National Park Service and state wildlife agencies publish fact sheets. Wildlife rehabilitators care for orphaned or injured opossums. Many people coexist with opossums in backyards; they are generally harmless and beneficial."

      "summary": "Didelphis virginiana biology: marsupial reproduction, “playing possum” (thanatosis), diet, and role in ecosystems; North America’s only marsupial.",
      "sections": {
        "what": "Didelphis virginiana (Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae) is the northernmost marsupial and the only one in North America. Morphology: plantigrade feet, prehensile tail (scaly, used for grasping and balance), and a marsupium (pouch) in females. Dentition: 50 teeth (five incisors per side on upper jaw); generalist omnivore. Range extends from southern Canada through the U.S. and Mexico to Central America. Tolerant of human-modified habitat; often found in suburbs, farms, and woodland edges.",
        "why": "Opossums provide ecosystem services: consumption of ticks (potential Lyme reduction), carrion removal, and seed dispersal. They are a model for marsupial biology in the Northern Hemisphere. Mortality from vehicles is high; they are also prey for dogs, coyotes, and raptors. They are not a conservation concern (widespread) but are culturally and ecologically significant.",
        "how": "Reproduction: short gestation (12–13 days), altricial young (≈0.5 in) crawl to pouch and attach to one of 13 nipples; weaning and emergence at ~2 months; riding on mother’s back follows. Thanatosis (“playing possum”): involuntary-looking state of immobility, can last minutes; may deter some predators. Thermoregulation: ear and tail vasculature; relatively low metabolic rate. Diet: invertebrates, vertebrates, fruit, carrion; opportunistic and flexible.",
        "keyFacts": "Smithsonian National Zoo and NPS provide authoritative accounts. Britannica covers morphology and behavior. Research on tick consumption and thanatosis appears in wildlife and physiology journals. Coexistence: no feeding, no handling; reduce attractants and road mortality where possible.",
        "stepByStep": "(1) Use Smithsonian or NPS for range, diet, and life history. (2) Compare Virginia opossum to another marsupial (e.g. kangaroo): pouch, gestation, young development. (3) Read about thanatosis: what might be the benefit? (4) Relate to ecosystems: pest consumption, carrion, and seed dispersal.",
        "realWorldExamples": "Smithsonian National Zoo holds Virginia opossums and publishes care and biology. NPS (e.g. Civil War Defenses of Washington) has nature fact sheets. State wildlife agencies and rehabilitators provide guidance. Peer-reviewed work on opossum ecology and physiology is available in mammalogy and wildlife journals."

      "sections": {
        "what": "Didelphis virginiana (Mammalia, Didelphimorphia, Didelphidae) is one of several Didelphis species; D. virginiana is the only member north of Mexico. Morphology reflects marsupial bauplan: epipubic bones, marsupium, and altricial young with extended lactation. Dentition (I 5/4, C 1/1, P 3/3, M 4/4) supports omnivory. Range and population genetics are well documented; the species is expanding northward in some areas, possibly with climate and human landscape change.",
        "why": "As the only North American marsupial, D. virginiana is important for comparative biology and education. Ecosystem services (tick predation, carrion consumption) are studied in disease and nutrient cycling contexts. Thanatosis has been studied as anti-predator behavior. Conservation status is secure; management focuses on coexistence and rehabilitation.",
        "how": "Marsupial reproduction: short gestation, chorionic villi in some species; young complete development in pouch. Thanatosis: likely mediated by stress response; duration and effectiveness vary. Diet: stable isotopes and gut content show broad omnivory. Sources: Smithsonian National Zoo, NPS, Britannica, and peer-reviewed mammalogy and wildlife journals.",
        "keyFacts": "Sources: Smithsonian National Zoo (nationalzoo.si.edu/animals/virginia-opossum), NPS nature guides, Encyclopaedia Britannica. Research on tick consumption (e.g. Lyme ecology), thanatosis, and reproduction appears in peer-reviewed literature.",
        "stepByStep": "Evidence-based sequence: (1) Consult Smithsonian and NPS for biology and range. (2) For marsupial comparison: use zoology texts or museum resources. (3) For ecosystem role: use wildlife and disease ecology literature. (4) For coexistence: follow wildlife agency guidance (no feeding, no handling).",
        "realWorldExamples": "Smithsonian National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute hold Virginia opossums and publish species information. NPS and state agencies provide public education. Research on opossum ecology, behavior, and disease relations appears in Journal of Mammalogy and related journals."
